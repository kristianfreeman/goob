goob is an experimental eavt database, inspired by [datomic](https://www.datomic.com/) and [datascript](https://github.com/tonsky/datascript), but built for use in javascript applications. ideally, it will become an in-memory, embedded database that can be used for building weird applications like [roam](https://roamresearch.com) or [athens](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens)

please do not use it, i have absolutely no idea what i'm doing
